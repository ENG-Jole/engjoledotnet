## Moving to CloudFront and S3

Remember how I said the Docker container method wasn't the best way to run this site?

I was absolutely right. I had spent enough time looking at ```hugo deploy``` while writing the Foobar posts I realized it'd be super easy and probably cheaper just to move everything to a bucket with CloudFront in front of it...and after looking at the price calculator I was right. Damn, S3 is cheap. So, here we are.

To do this, I created an S3 bucket and CloudFront distro, added the deploy info to my ```config.toml```, gave it a test run, and was happy with how smooth it was. I then updated my GitHub actions workflow to set up AWS creds and treat the S3 and CloudFront IDs as a secret, committed, watched as my build failed because of a sed delimiter thing, fixed that, and then woo! CI/CD to S3.

I ran a ping test against the old Docker server and the CloudFront distro while I had both up:

The averages say it all: CloudFront is 7x faster than my old DO server, as one would hope and think üòâ.

I think I've held onto doing websites on VPSes for so long because of the old-school ops feeling of nostalgia it brings, and I think my DO fleet will still have a place in my personal infrastructure. But for this site at least, CloudFront is going to rule for a good long while.
