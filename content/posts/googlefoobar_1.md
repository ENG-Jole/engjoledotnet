# I Do DevOps

So, to start off, I don't like LeetCode (like many people), code challenges, or code golf, mainly for two reasons.

One, it has little bearing on what I actually do, namely: make sure developers have the tools they need, and that customers are well-supported with good code and good infrastructure (and good infrastructure as code). Two, vis a vis one, these types of things do not do a good job telling me or a company whether or not someone would be good at the above things.

I value clean, easy-to-read and easy-to-collaborate-on code, rather than the _most_ tricky-dick, super-hyper-optimal algorithms everywhere. There is definitely a time and place for hyper-efficient code; but very often in DevOps land using, for example, modules from the Python standard library or the Rust standard library is not only clean and DRY, but also very often _optimal_ for that particular task. But if you're the most clever coder in the world, and you write overcomplicated spaghetti code that no one can understand,  then _you are actually a shit coder and not at all that clever_.

I think the above is a good way to distinguish between _computer science_ and _software engineering_, a much-talked about dichotomy. Computer scientists ask, "Can this be more efficient?". Software engineers ask, "Can we ship it?". I am definitely in the latter camp, but with a philosophy degree I do have some knowledge of the former.

But this is all to say: I do DevOps, I don't do code challenges.

# I'm Doing (Or Did) A Code Challenge

So surprise surprise when I found myself getting _really_ into Google FooBar when I got invited the other day while doing research for a platform project I'm leading. It is, of course, not an everyday occurrence that one gets invited by the all-powerful Google, based on whatever fancy ML neural net they use to fingerprint browsers and find out who you are, to participate in [their famous maybe-recruiting tool, definite-fun time program](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-hired-by-google-b19806ad3c62). So, here I am.

Like I said before, _I do DevOps_, so thinking in this specific manner is quite new to me, but also quite enjoyable! I think mainly it's because these challenges are so detached from any practical concerns I am able to go full theory reaaaally easily and go deep down the rabbit hole. And if I end up getting an interview with Google, it'll certainly be a fun story, right?

I'll be writing a [blog post](https://engjole.net/categories/foobar) for every challenge I complete, outlining my thought processes on how I solved it, in addition to the background for the challenge. I'll also be posting my code on GitHub at [this repo](https://github.com/ENG-Jole/foobar.withgoogle) for everyone to see, so everyone can tell me I should have used some other tricky dick optimal algo \\s.
