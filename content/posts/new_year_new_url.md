## I Am, Once Again, Still Alive, And Just Had A Very Busy 2023
And now it's time for my (apparently) yearly blog post! What a year!

## I Got Married!!!
I said "I do" to my wonderful wife on October 21 in Portland, OR! It was, as expected, the best day of my life, so filled with love, care, and joy; and it was also the end result of a year-long quasi-Agile effort to bring it all together. We are _still_ exhausted from planning and executing it--but hey, this means I can put "project manager" on my resume, right?
As one might have noticed I changed my name when I got married, thus the shiny new URL. Unfortunately I have not yet bothered to run sed against this website's codebase, since slightly more important things like bank accounts and identity documents have taken priority, so there's going to be some little remnants of my maiden name all over.

## Go Is (Probably) My Favorite Programming Language Now
And I wrote a _lot_ of it over the past year. Can neither confirm or deny if Stockholm Syndrome has anything to do with my favoritism.
One day, I will elaborate (and also talk about my Smarandache-Wellin number library for Python, written in Rust)... but it's late and I wrote this all on my phone, so until next year!
