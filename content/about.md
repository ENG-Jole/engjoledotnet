## About Me
Hi hi. I'm an SRE, currently at [ConductorOne](https://conductorone.com). I used to work at [Box](https://www.box.com). You can call me EJ.

## About This Blog

This is (mainly) (kinda sorta) a tech blog. I mostly have written about Python, how much I hate coding challenges but do them anyway for Funâ„¢, and various other musings about tech with random life updates thrown in sometimes. No regular cadence, no regular theme, just whatever I feel like writing!

Also: hi if you're a recruiter and I applied to your company! It's nice to see people

## (Actually) About Me

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer - Reliability (or Sr. SRE) at [ConductorOne](https://conductorone.com).

Obligatory: views are my own and not my employer's.

I'm a highly adaptable and versatile engineer with a wide variety of experiences across technical environments and a strong systems and software engineering background. I have designed CI/CD pipelines, wrangled Kubernetes clusters, ran multiple 100+ node distributed computing clusters, and turned fragile, opaque, automation into scalable, resilient, transparent, services throughout my career. I'm a whole-systems thinker, believe that reliability is everyone's responsibility, and know that empathy and moral decision making are key engineering skills.

My favorite programming language is Go, and I also am generally a fan of Python, Rust, Haskell, JavaScript/TypeScript, SvelteKit, and Pkl. I prefer vim over emacs and zsh over bash. In general I have varied interests in tech, including: SRE strategy, systems design, platform engineering, vintage Apple products, and functional programming. You can see my full resume [here]({{< ref "resume.md" >}} "Resume").

Outside of tech, I'm interested in wine, cocktails, specialty coffee, tea, fine dining, science fiction, Japanese literature, literary fiction, poetry, writing, experimental, participatory, & interactive theater, photography, art broadly, philosophy (specifically moral psychology, philosophy of language, epistemic injustice, and metaphilosophy), linguistics (specifically semantics, pragmatics, and onomastics), OSINT, cycling, and urban planning & history. I dearly miss Anthony Bourdain.

I am also deeply invested in justice and equity within tech, especially LGBTQ and gender equity, and I strive for a more perfect internet and a more perfect world, and I'm motivated to cultivate empathy, grace, good faith, and kindness in tech. Please feel free to connect with me, even if you just want to chat!
