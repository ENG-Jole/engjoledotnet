## About This Blog

This is (mainly) (kinda sorta) a tech blog. I mostly write about Python, how much I hate coding challenges but do them anyway for Fun™, and various other musings about tech with random life updates thrown in sometimes. No regular cadence, no regular theme, just whatever I feel like writing!

## About Me

I am currently a Site Reliability Engineer on the Data Transformation Reliability Engineering team at [Box](https://www.box.com), driving observability and reliability for data transformation infrastructure.

Obligatory: views are my own and not my employer's.

I have varied interests in tech, including: DevOps/SRE strategy, serverless automation, system design, Infrastructure as Code & Infrastructure as a (internal) Service, Linux administration, vintage Apple products, functional programming, and k8s at the edge. My favorite programming language is Rust (although I don’t consider myself a systems programmer) and I also am generally a fan of Python, Haskell, Deno, and Go. I prefer vim over emacs and zsh over bash. I’d love to get deeper with TS/Deno, Go, Rust, and Kotlin as well. You can see my full resume [here]({{< ref "resume.md" >}} "Resume")

I also contribute to the [Hunge Labs](https://github.com/hungelabs) project, an nascent open-source specialty coffee knowledgebase. As one might figure out I am deep into specialty coffee.

Outside of tech, I’m interested in linguistics, philosophy, specialty coffee (you might see me on the James Hoffmann Discord), cycling, mass transit, urban planning, art, [photography](https://https:engjolephotography.com), wine, cocktails, and food. I dearly miss Anthony Bourdain.

I am also deeply invested in justice and equity within tech, especially LGBTQ and gender equity, and I strive for a more perfect internet and a more perfect world, and I'm motivated to cultivate empathy, grace, good faith, and kindness in tech. Please feel free to connect with me, even if you just want to chat!
