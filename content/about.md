## About Me
Hi hi. I'm an SRE, currently at [ConductorOne](https://conductorone.com). I used to work at [Box](https://www.box.com). You can call me EJ.

## About This Blog

This is (mainly) (kinda sorta) a tech blog. I mostly write about Python, how much I hate coding challenges but do them anyway for Fun™, and various other musings about tech with random life updates thrown in sometimes. No regular cadence, no regular theme, just whatever I feel like writing!

Also: hi if you're a recruiter and I applied to your company! It's nice to see people

## (Actually) About Me

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer - Reliability (or Sr. SRE) at [ConductorOne](https://conductorone.com).

Obligatory: views are my own and not my employer's.

I'm a highly adaptable and versatile engineer with a wide variety of experiences across technical environments and a strong systems and software engineering background. I have designed CI/CD pipelines, wrangled Kubernetes clusters, ran multiple 100+ node distributed computing clusters, and turned fragile, opaque, automation into scalable, resilient, transparent, services throughout my career. I'm a whole-systems thinker, believe that reliability is everyone's responsibility, and know that empathy and moral decision making are key engineering skills.

My favorite programming language is Python, and I also am generally a fan of Rust, Haskell, JavaScript/TypeScript, SvelteKit, and Go. I prefer vim over emacs and zsh over bash. In general I have varied interests in tech, including: SRE/DevOps strategy, system design, platform engineering, vintage Apple products, and functional programming. You can see my full resume [here]({{< ref "resume.md" >}} "Resume").

I also have contributed to the [Hunge Labs](https://github.com/hungelabs) project, an nascent open-source specialty coffee knowledgebase. As one might figure out I am deep into specialty coffee.

Outside of tech, I’m interested in linguistics, philosophy, specialty coffee (you might see me on the James Hoffmann Discord), cycling, mass transit, urban planning, art, photography, wine, cocktails, and food. I dearly miss Anthony Bourdain.

I am also deeply invested in justice and equity within tech, especially LGBTQ and gender equity, and I strive for a more perfect internet and a more perfect world, and I'm motivated to cultivate empathy, grace, good faith, and kindness in tech. Please feel free to connect with me, even if you just want to chat!
