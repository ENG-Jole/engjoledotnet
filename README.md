![S3/CloudFront Deploy](https://github.com/ENG-Jole/engjoledotnet/actions/workflows/build-deploy.yml/badge.svg)

This is the repo for [my personal website](https://www.engjole.net).

It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and GitHub actions to deploy static content to S3 when I push to it.

There's nothing super special here, other than a few changes here and there, but it's worth showing off the CI/CD pipeline.
